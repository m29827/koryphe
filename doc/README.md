## Binary Operator Examples
 
### Adapted Binary Operator applied to a complex object

This example shows how you can apply a simple binary operator (in this case Product) to aggregate a field in a complex object. We will configure the Product function to apply to field 'A' in a Tuple. The result of the product function will be projected back into field 'A'.

[TupleAggregationProductExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/binaryoperator/TupleAggregationProductExample.java) shows how to create this operator using the Java API. Execute it to produce the following output:

```
Binary Operator json: 
{
  "binaryOperator" : {
    "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Product"
  },
  "selection" : [ "A" ]
}

Binary Operator inputs: 
{1,2,3}
{4,5,6}
{7,8,9}

Binary Operator output: 
{28,2,3}
```

Field 'A' has been selected from each of the input tuples and passed to the Product operator. The result has been projected back into the first input tuple.

### Composite adapted Binary Operator applied to a complex object

This example shows the composition of a complex Binary Operator by applying simple operators to different fields in a complex object. We will configure the Product, Sum and Min functions to apply to fields A, B and C respectively.

[TupleCompositeAggregationExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/binaryoperator/TupleCompositeAggregationExample.java) shows how to create this operator using the Java API. Execute it to produce the following output:

```
Binary Operator json: 
{
  "operators" : [ {
    "binaryOperator" : {
      "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Product"
    },
    "selection" : [ "A" ]
  }, {
    "binaryOperator" : {
      "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Sum"
    },
    "selection" : [ "B" ]
  }, {
    "binaryOperator" : {
      "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.binaryoperator.Min"
    },
    "selection" : [ "C" ]
  } ]
}

Binary Operator inputs: 
{1,2,3}
{4,5,6}
{7,8,9}

Binary Operator output: 
{28,15,3}
```

Field 'A' has been aggregated by the Product operator, field 'B' by the Sum operator and field 'C' by the Min operator.



## Function Examples
 
### Simple Function

In it's simplest form, Koryphe works the same as the Java Function API - it shows a single function being applied to a single input.

[MultiplyByExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/function/MultiplyByExample.java) shows how to create one of these functions using the Java API. Executing it produces the following output:

```
Function json: 
{
  "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.function.MultiplyBy",
  "by" : 2
}

Function inputs: 
1
2
3

Function outputs: 
2
4
6
```

Each input has been multiplied by 2 to produce the stream of output values.

### Simple multi input, single output function

This example shows a Koryphe function that has more than one input value. To do this, we wrap inputs in a tuple.

<img src="images/function/simpleMultiInSingleOutFunction.png" width="600">

[MultiplyExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/function/MultiplyExample.java) shows how to create one of these functions using the Java API. Executing it produces the following output:

```
Function json: 
{
  "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.function.Multiply"
}

Function inputs: 
{1,1}
{1,2}
{2,2}

Function outputs: 
1
2
4
```

The function has been used to multiply the 2 input values together, producing a stream of single output values.

### Simple single input, multi output function

In a similar way to the previous example, this example shows how functions can return multiple values by wrapping them in a tuple.

[DivideByExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/function/DivideByExample.java) shows how to create one of these functions using the Java API. Executing it produces the following output:

```
Function json: 
{
  "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.function.DivideBy",
  "by" : 3
}

Function inputs: 
3
6
10

Function outputs: 
{1,0}
{2,0}
{3,1}
```

The function has divided each input by 3, outputting the result of the division and the remainder as a tuple. 

### Simple multi input, multi output function

Bringing the previous 2 examples together, here we show a function with more than one input and output.

[DivideExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/function/DivideExample.java) shows how to create one of these functions using the Java API. Executing it produces the following output:

{
  "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.function.Divide"
}

Function inputs: 
{8,1}
{8,2}
{8,3}

Function outputs: 
{8,0}
{4,0}
{2,2}
```

The function has divided the first element of the input tuple by the second to produce the division result and remainder as an output tuple.

### Single input, single output Function applied to a complex object

This example shows how you can apply a simple function to a field in a complex object. We will configure the function to apply to field 'A' in a Tuple. The result of the function will be projected back into field 'D'.

[TupleMultiplyByExample.java](src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/koryphe/example/function/TupleMultiplyByExample.java) shows how to create this adapted function using the Java API. Execute it to produce the following output:

```
Function json: 
{
  "function" : {
    "class" : "uk.gov.gchq.koryphe.impl.function.MultiplyBy",
    "by" : 2
  },
  "selection" : [ "A" ],
  "projection" : [ "D" ]
}

Function inputs: 
{1,2,3}
{4,5,6}
{7,8,9}

Function outputs: 
{1,2,3,2}
{4,5,6,8}
{7,8,9,14}
```

Field 'A' has been selected from each of the input tuples and passed to the function, which multiplies it by 2. The results have been projected back into a new field 'D'.

### Multiple input, single output Function applied to a complex object

This example shows how you can apply a function to multiple fields in a complex object. We will configure the function to apply to field 'A' and 'B' in a Tuple. The result of the function will be projected back into field 'D'.

### Composite Function applied to a complex object

This example shows how you can combine functions into a composite and apply it to fields in a complex object, projecting multiple output objects. We will configure a composite function to apply one function to field 'A' and project it's result into field 'E', and apply another function to field 'B' and project it's result into field 'D'.
