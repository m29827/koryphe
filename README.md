# Koryphe

Koryphe is an extensible functions library for filtering, aggregating and transforming data based on the Java Function API. It provides:

 - Context adapted functions.
 - Function composition.
 - Functions with multiple inputs/outputs.
 - JSON serialisation.
 - Library of re-usable functions.
 
## Context adapted functions

Koryphe allows any Java 8 Function, BinaryOperator or Predicate to be adapted and applied to the values contained within a complex object such as a Tuple.

## Function composition

Functions (or BinaryOperators or Predicates) can be combined and applied together in a single composite function. This is particularly powerful when combined with context adapted functions, allowing composite functions to be built from a library of simple functions and applied to complex objects.

## Functions with multiple inputs/outputs

Koryphe can combine inputs and outputs into tuples, providing type-safe interfaces for functions that apply to and/or return more than one value.

## JSON serialisation

Functions, including composites, can be JSON serialised, allowing them to be used across distributed applications.

## Library of re-usable functions

Koryphe provides a number of useful Functions, BinaryOperators and Predicates for building simple applications.
