/**
 * <p>
 * An <code>InTimeRangeDual</code> is a {@link java.util.function.Predicate}
 * that tests if a start {@link Comparable} and end {@link Comparable} is
 * within a provided range [start, end]. Specifically the start {@link Comparable}
 * has to be greater than the start bound and the end {@link Comparable} has to
 * be less than the end bound.
 * By default the range is inclusive, you can toggle this using the startInclusive
 * and endInclusive booleans.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the start is not set then this will be treated as unbounded.
 * Similarly with the end.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the test value is null then the predicate will return false.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This range predicate takes 2 values to test, if you want to test
 * a single value lies within a range then you can use the
 * {@link InTimeRange} predicate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The range can also be configured using time offsets
 * from the current system time or a provided start/end time.
 * You can set the start and end offsets using startOffset and endOffset.
 * By default the offset is measured in Days, this can be changed to
 * DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND and MILLISECOND using the offsetUnit field.
 * <p>
 * At the point when test is called on the class the
 * current system time is used to calculate the start and end values based on:
 * System.currentTimeMillis() + offset.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default checks are carried out assuming the data will be in milliseconds.
 * If this is not the case you can change the time unit using the timeUnit property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can configure the start and end time strings using one of the following formats:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>timestamp in milliseconds</li>
 * <li>yyyy/MM</li>
 * <li>yyyy/MM/dd</li>
 * <li>yyyy/MM/dd HH</li>
 * <li>yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm</li>
 * <li>yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss</li>
 * </ul>
 * You can use a space, '-', '/', '_', ':', '|', or '.' to separate the parts.
